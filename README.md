Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

This is a GROUP project that took only 2 weeks to build by 4 developers.
The idea of the app came from when I was a chef. As a chef, I needed to minimise food waste especially the ones that are freshly made everyday. When the restaurant doesn't sell all the premade food, those food products will be thrown away in the bin.

To tackle this problem, one of the solutions could be an app such ass WHY WHY WASTE that allows restaurants owner to post their leftover food on the app with discounted prices. The app also allows customers to search for restaurants by map. This app suits for those people who are looking for cheap good quality food. On the other hand, restaurant owners who use this app can reduce their losses!
